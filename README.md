Jim's Backyard BBQ | Restaurant Project from Fall 2020 Semester

During my Fall 2020 semester at Middle Georgia State University, we had a midterm project to create a site for a fictious restaurant called SuperRestaurant. We 
had to include a homepage, contact, menu page as well as a fourth page of our choice. I was inspired to revamp this project by renaming it to Jim's Backyard BBQ.
